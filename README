The rails source for my current big website redesign. Always a 
work in progress.

Current goals:
  * [X] Do rails the right way. With testing and everything.
    * [ ] manage about page/favorite things, etc in db
    * [X] manage work experience for uniformity and printability
    * [X] manage remote site links for hcard/rel links/bio display
  * [X] omniauth
  * [ ] Social media bar
  * [ ] hcard/hresume
  * [X] HTML5 (boilerplate)
  * [X] HAML
  * [X] sass
  * [-] coffeescript (not using enough javascript to warrant it)
  * [-] ajaxy updatebits (would actually rather not have this right now)
  * [ ] minimalist design
  * [?] golden ratio (at full size the background tentacles do this. does it count?)
