The rails source for my website, http://tekniklr.com
Always a work in progress.

Not much that is visibly fancy to the end user, but I put some shinyness into the
admin end in a quasi CMS sort of way.

Also, it's designed to be a rails app with a running wordpress in the public/
directory, so that's kinda neat. It's also not that hard; just make sure you have
something like this in your apache config:
  <Location /wpblog>
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    PassengerEnabled off
  </Location>
I don't know of any way to do this other than with Passenger.

Anyway, things I used while implementing this include:
  *  TDD
  *  DRY
  *  omniauth
  *  HTML5 (boilerplate)
  *  HAML
  *  sass
  *  CoffeeScript
  *  modern railsy ajax
